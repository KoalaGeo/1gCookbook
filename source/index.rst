The pages linked from here might be linked from a number of places on http://onegeology.org. This page at the moment just acts to group all the content being authored roughly under the "OneGeology Cookbook" type content area.

There are two main areas being covered; first is how to use OneGeology and second (the major part) is how to provide services for OneGeology. Currently there is a bit of overlap in general OneGeology introductory type of material in the "cookbook" sections and other pages on the onegeology.org site. Other pages on the onegeology site that have overlapping content which we should consider together with cookbook content are:

* http://onegeology.org/what_is/home.html and all the subsections are introductions to OneGeology which we should point to where appropriate rather than duplicating.
* http://onegeology.org/participants/home.html is a high-level description of what it means to participate in OneGeolgy as a provider so could be pointed to from how to provide services introduction.
* http://onegeology.org/getting_involved/home.html and http://onegeology.org/getting_involved/get_involved.cfm are the bits participating organisations will have read and form submitted when expressing interest in becoming providers so note from service provision introduction.
* The `Techical overview <http://onegeology.org/technical_progress/home.html>`_ and sub-sections (http://onegeology.org/technical_progress/users.html, http://onegeology.org/technical_progress/geosciml.html and http://onegeology.org/portal/portal_uses.html) feel like a bit of an oddity with a lot of overlap with cookbook high-level introductory content.
* http://onegeology.org/portal/home.html - Should this page exist separately or instead be a direct link to cookbook chapter on portal?

OneGeology documentation for users and service providers.

Source files are written in [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) and built into HTML pages using the [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) documentation generator. When ready the pages can be [published](publishing.md) to the http://www.onegeology.org website and form a part of its content.

Replaces old separate WMS, WFS and WCS Cookbooks.

Commits to master will build HTML pages and make them available at http://geowebservices.glpages.ad.nerc.ac.uk/1gCookbook/use/home.html and http://geowebservices.glpages.ad.nerc.ac.uk/1gCookbook/service_provision/home.html.

The HTML pages can be built to include "ToDo" notes or not; see `todo_include_todos` flag in conf.py files. These are to provide reminders, notes about planned content or changes etc. while editing but should not be included when publishing to the external website.

Installing PostGIS
------------------

The `PostGIS Installation <http://www.postgis.net/install>`_ page contains instructions on how to install PostGIS for different operating systems. We have used both the `Enterprise DB Windows Installer <https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads>`_ on Windows and the `PostgreSQL Yum repository <https://yum.postgresql.org/>`_ on CentOS.

   Don't think we want to go into more detail on installation ourselves?

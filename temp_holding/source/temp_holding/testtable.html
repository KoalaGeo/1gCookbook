  <tbody>
  <tr><td class="rqd">identifier</td><td>xs:string</td><td>Globally unique identifier for the individual feature. Recommended practice is that this identifier be derived from the primary key for the spatial objects in the source data in case information needs to be transferred from the interchange format back to the source database. This identifier is analogous to the identifier for a GeoSciML MappedFeature.</td></tr>      
  <tr><td>name</td><td>xs:string</td><td>Display name for the ShearDisplacementStructure. This may be a generic fault type, e.g. ‘<i>thrust fault</i>’, ‘strike-slip fault’, or a particular fault name, e.g. ‘<i>Moine thrust</i>’, ‘san Andreas Fault’.</td></tr>      
  <tr><td>description</td><td>xs:string</td><td>Text description of the ShearDisplacementStructure, typically taken from an entry on a geological map legend.</td></tr>      
  <tr><td>faultType</td><td>xs:string</td><td>Type of ShearDisplacementStructure (as defined in GeoSciML).</td></tr>      
  <tr><td>movementType</td><td>xs:string</td><td>Summary of the type of movement (e.g. dip-slip, strike-slip) on the ShearDisplacementStructure.</td></tr>     
  <tr><td>deformationStyle</td><td>xs:string</td><td>Description of the style of deformation (e.g. brittle, ductile etc) for the ShearDisplacementStructure.</td></tr>       
  <tr><td>displacement</td><td>xs:string</td><td>Text summary of displacement across the ShearDisplacementStructure.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>geologicHistory</td><td>xs:string</td><td>Text (possibly formatted with formal syntax) description of the sequence of events that formed and have affected the ShearDisplacementStructure. Events include process and optional environment information.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>observationMethod</td><td>xs:string</td><td>Metadata snippet indicating how the spatial extent of the feature was determined. ObservationMethod is a convenience property that provides a quick and dirty approach to observation metadata when data are reported using a feature view (as opposed to observation view).</td></tr>
  <tr><td>positionalAccuracy</td><td>xs:string</td><td>Preferred use is a quantitative value defining the radius of an uncertainty buffer around a MappedFeature, e.g. a positionAccuracy of 100 m for a line feature defines a buffer polygon of total width 200 m centered on the line. Some other text description that quantifies position accuracy may be provided, e.g. a term from a controlled vocabulary. Vocabulary used should be described in the dataset metadata.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>source</td><td>xs:string</td><td>Text describing feature specific details and citations to source materials, and if available providing URLs to reference material and publications describing the geologic feature. This could be a short text synopsis of key information that would also be in the metadata record referenced by metadata_uri.</td></tr>

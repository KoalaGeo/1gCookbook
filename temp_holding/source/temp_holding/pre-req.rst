Prerequisites for setting up an OGC Web Service
===============================================

    Consider moving this section, as it isn't MapServer specific

You may set up and configure an OWS on any PC or laptop running the appropriate software (and you may have to do this if you donâ€™t have a networked PC or internet server).  To serve such a service on the OneGeology Portal you must have an open access Internet connected machine on which the server software can be installed and kept running.

    This section could go in data prep, or more general section about example datasets, as we also have WFS postgres database to play with.  We don't have a GeoTiff at present, did we ever?

As far as source data goes, the examples will concentrate mainly on GeoTIFF format raster files and ESRI shapefiles for vector data.  However, access to other formats of raster data, and many possible vector formats, including access to spatial databases are listed on the MapServer website.

See the MapServer help pages (as below) for further information: `Raster Data <http://www.MapServer.org/input/raster.html>`_, `Vector Data <http://www.MapServer.org/input/vector/index.html>`_  and `Information about OGR <http://www.MapServer.org/input/vector/ogr.html>`_.
